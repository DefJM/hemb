      <description>Writing a paper or dissertation can be very hard. I have had several students going through what they experienced as a daunting challenge. When asking for advise, I used to tell them that I, too, struggled. And I shared bits and pieces how I managed. Last week I finally wrote up those pieces as a whole.
TLDR: My main advise is to work in time-boxed writing blocks. In each block, you stick to only one writing mode.</description>
