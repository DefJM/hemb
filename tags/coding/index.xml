      <description>Writing a paper or dissertation can be very hard. I have had several students going through what they experienced as a daunting challenge. When asking for advise, I used to tell them that I, too, struggled. And I shared bits and pieces how I managed. Last week I finally wrote up those pieces as a whole.
TLDR: My main advise is to work in time-boxed writing blocks. In each block, you stick to only one writing mode.</description>

      <description>Sometimes finding the right example helps a lot. Even more so when it is visible. It makes things clear and people get it.
More than once I find myself explaining the importance of version control to non-developers. The concept is important not only to just to code but to many more areas such as data sets and machine learning models. More than once, unfortunately, business folks struggle to understand its value.</description>
