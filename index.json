Options to calibrate are described here. Read about the fuse.js scoring theory here. Under the hood, fuse.js uses the Bitap algorithm. Weights PaperMod explains it here. Weight is used to control the positioning of entries. The Hugo Wiki:\nA non-zero integer indicating the entry’s position relative the root of the menu, or to its parent for a child entry. Lighter entries float to the top, while heavier entries sink to the bottom.\nFor example, we sort our top right menu as follows:\nbuttons: - name: Posts url: posts weight: 10 - name: Search url: search weight: 20 - name: Tags url: tags weight: 30 - name: Archives url: archives weight: 40 Page header template Each post has a dedicated section for metadata.
