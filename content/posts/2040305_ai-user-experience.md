## User experience and usability for (Gen-)AI applications

AI applications are different from conventional software systems in many ways. Lately I have been thinking a lot about their implications for user experience and usability. Challenges are manifold, ranging from managing the probabilistic nature of AI, to designing, testing and monitoring an effective chat bot experience, and understanding novel fallacies in LLM prompt-engineering as a developer. This post intends to provide an overview of AI-specific usability challenges. 

- Use case development: Understanding and designing around the probabilistic nature of AI is hard
- Prompt engineering: Non-expert prompt engineers struggle with AI during development and implementation of chatbots
- Chatbots: End-users struggle to grasp LLM and RAG limitations
- AI-security: Wide-ranging AI-security threats often have their root in organisational and user-related mis-alignments, even more so than in technology issues


All their core, these challenges have in common that they are human-machine-interface (HMI) problems. Put simply, AI and GenAI-applications are a new category of tools for human end-users. When used effectively, these tools provide great benefit, conversely, when mis-understood and mis-used, they threaten to cause great damage. 

### AI use case development


### Prompt engineering 
 - paper: "johnny can't prompt"


### Chatbot limitations for end-users
- paper: ragged technology frontier, centaurs and cyborgs


### AI-security: Usability is a powerful security handle, which we should use more!
